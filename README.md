# CKV-game

For school, we have an obligated subject called "CKV", which is basically advanced arts and crafts. This period, our project was architecture. We had to choose between 3 different projects that had different requirements: A mansion, a new multinational headquarters or a bridge/viaduct. I chose the multinational headquarters. I planned to make this in Blender with the presentation being a Unity "game"-ish thing, there's no objective to the game, but you can walk around and really *experience* the building (and obviously there would be easter eggs because I'm addicted to easter eggs). Before that, I hadn't been up-to-date on the newer additions to Blender, the last version I had used was 2.79b (which was for the project before this coincidentally). I had noticed that 2.8+ was wildly different from the previous versions, so there was a steep learning curve involved (more on that later), but obviously using later versions of both Unity and Blender would have better-looking end-products, so I chose to partake in that learning curve.

### Know that I had to make this "game" as quick as possible, I started with it the day of the deadline, the day I also had to work for ~5 hours, I made this within about 1.5 days if I had to guess. I spent every single moment of free time I had in the weekend on this, so please don't have your expectations too high. A lot of the code is extremely rule-based and hard-coded, there's some major bugs in the "game", etc. I would have (and still might) made it better with more easter eggs if I hadn't procrastinated as much.

## The process of the game

To be honest, the whole process was slow, pain and agony. Models not rendering from the inside (something to do with backwards culling or something) while being open and very much not solid, mesh colliders not working, physics not at all acting in the way Newton would have wanted, attempts to completely redo materials about 3x, model redesigns, etc. I don't think I have ever made this many screenshots and videos of any project not working. Here is a preview:

Making the door was surprisingly easy though, so I'm not complaining!

Overall I'm just glad to say I'm done, obviously most of the complaining above is just my own stupidity, I've tried using Unity2D and Unity3D before and game development really just isn't for me. Sure I'm capable of making some basic stuff (like this), but I don't know enough nor am interested enough to really have the passion to learn anything more (contrary to any information system). I will be posting my CKV portfolio at the end of the year and updating it each year, it'll be available for play there. Also check the release page, unless I forget, it'll be available there.

## Gameplay

Just use W, A, S, D to move, space to jump, Ctrl to crouch, shift to sprint (as it should be), e to open the menu to use the "elevator" (you just teleport really) and destroy the ugly building to replace it with a much more beautiful building. Jump height is insane to make jumping between floors easier. I probably should have made a slider to in-/decrease jump height in the menu, but alas.
